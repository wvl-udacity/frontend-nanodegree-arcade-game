frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================

To run the game, first clone the repository and then open the index.html
file in a browser. Use the arrow keys to move the player.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wvl-udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game.git
open frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/index.html
```

The game works as follows:
- The player can move within the screen bounds.
- If the player collides with a bug (an enemy), the game will be reset and the player will be moved back to the starting position.
- The goal is to reach the water. Once this is done, the game is won and will start over.
